==============

Sample application to demostrate usage of MvaCrud module

Installation
------------
clone the repository and manually invoke `composer` using the shipped `composer.phar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    git clone git://github.com/rinomeu/CrudExampleApp.git
    cd CrudExampleApp
    php composer.phar self-update
